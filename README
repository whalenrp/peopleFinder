A test project for Professor Schmidt's upcoming Android Operating Systems class.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate uses of the following:
	1) Content Providers
	2) Services
	3) GPS/maps
	4) Service Binder
	5) SyncAdapters (optional)

To do this, we have created a server that will ultimately serve as a directory
service. When any given phone connects to it, it will be given a list of IP
addresses of other phones to communicate with. The phone can then post updates
to its current position directly to the other phones without having to 
connect to the main server.
